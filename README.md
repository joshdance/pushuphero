Pushups. Tracking. Goals. Fun.

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when real life happened. Only the Pushup Hero, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed her most, she vanished. A couple of months passed and my creator imagined the new Pushup Hero, and although she pushup tracking  skills are improving, she has a lot to learn before she's ready for the App Store. But I believe Pushup Hero can save the world...

If you get the joke above, 10 points to Gryffindor.

Track your pushups.

I made this because my goal is to do 10,000 pushups in 2019. 

Here is the link to download the app on the App Store - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushup-hero/id1410662331
